Hello there! My name is Kafui Godzi. I use she/her/hers pronouns. I graduated from my  masters student in Public Policy & Management at Carnegie Mellon University. Originally from Ghana, my undergraduate degree was in Business Administration Accounting. I am a versatile Data Analyst with over 3 years of experience, currently working at Ernst and Young. I am certified in Alteryx Designer Core and Google's Foundations: Data, Data, Everywhere. My technical skills include Python, R, SQL, Tableau, Alteryx, ArcGIS, and Microsoft Office Suite. I specialize in developing analytics solutions using Alteryx and Power BI. I have a proven track record in improving operational efficiency, managing large datasets, and coordinating with teams to build consensus on proposed solutions. For more details, visit my LinkedIn profile at www.linkedin.com/in/kafui-godzi. Over the years, my passion for problem-solving has largely informed the activities I invest my time in. From assisting a women-focused nonprofit with graphic designing to consulting for small-medium enterprises in Ghana, I always seek opportunities to make meaningful impact in any community I find myself in. Outside of my professional life, I thoroughly enjoy catching up on the latest fashion, occasionally sketching out clothing designs and learning about new developments in dermatology.

## What I learnt
My coursework in the Public Policy & Management program here has provided me with a wide variety of data analytics skills, such as programming, database management and geospatial network analysis among others. As such, I hope that this course will provide me with the skills to succinctly and persuasively communicate ideas, which stem from processing large datasets, to a general audience.
